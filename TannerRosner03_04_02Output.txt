The unanimous Declaration of the
thirteen united States of America,

When in the course of human events
it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another,
and to assume among the powers of the earth,
the separate and equal station to which
the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them
a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the separation.
